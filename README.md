# 🚀 **Building a Web Server**  

## **📌 Overview**

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Multi-threaded request handling** – Uses threads to process requests concurrently.  
✅ **Configurable delay** – The server introduces a delay before responding.  
✅ **Thread-safe queue** – Manages incoming requests efficiently.

# 🛠️ **Project Setup**  

### **📥 Cloning an Existing Repository**  
If you already have the project on GitHub, run the following commands:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/4GOAT-4RUST/sync_https_server.git
cd sync_https_server
```

### **📦 Starting a New Rust Project**  
If you’re starting from scratch, create a new Rust project:  
```sh
cargo new sync_https_server --bin
cd sync_https_server
```
Then, initialize Git and link it to your GitHub repository:  
```sh
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/4GOAT-4RUST/sync_https_server.git
